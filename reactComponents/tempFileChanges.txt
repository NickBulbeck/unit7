Managing State and Data Flow
----------------------------
 - Zeroth vid is an intro; no code changes here.
 - First vid refactors the files by moving state out of child components into parents, and turns them back into statement function components.
 - Second vid refactors child components by passing callbacks upwards.
 - Third vid refactors them again by passing player index around
 - Fourth vid adds a stats component
 - Fifth vid adds an add-player form; because it's an addition, there's not as much refactoring.
 - Sixth vid adds the functionality to add players to the scoreboard
 - Seventh vid is about keeping track of state vs previous state; it reprises the sixth vid and refactors it.

 So: we need to create one new version of all the code for this.
