  // constructor() {
  //   super() 
  //   this.state = { 
  //     score: Math.floor((Math.random() * 10) + 1)
  //   }

    });     // and needs re-rendering. Also note that you pass it a nobject with the
  }         // state item you're changing, and what you're changing it to.
// Now: setState isn't always synchronous. If there's a lot going on, React may bundle
// the various calls for speed. This means that you can get race conditions, and other
// unexpected behaviour. You can modify state based on specific previous state by 
// passing setState a callback.

// to the context of the instance of the class.
// The other approach is to use an arrow function like I've done with decrement score. In this case
// you need the () because you're telling the arrow function what to do when it's called.
// arrow functions use lexical this binding - they automatically bind their contents to the 
// scope in which they're defined. Yet another approach is to write incrementScore as an arrow
// function in the first place.
