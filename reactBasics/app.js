// And Now: types of state.
// There are two types of state to think about when designing an app. There's 
// application state, and component state. The former is the data available
// to the entire application. Component state is local to the component and is
// not visible outside it. Like global and local variables.

/* 
  There's a basic pitfall with the setState() method: it's asynchronous. React tends to
  bundle setState() calls together and then run them at once for performance reasons.
  So you can get race conditions. In other words, when you increment the counter (for 
  instance) by increasing the current value of this.state.score, you can't guarrantee what
  the current value is (suppose a lot of - and + button clicks happen in quick succession).

  Thus, instead of just a nobject, setState() can also accept a callback that sets state
  based on the previous state.

  The other thing we're doing here is removing items from the state, and specifically, 
  removing players.
