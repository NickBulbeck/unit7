Managing State and Data Flow
----------------------------
 - Zeroth vid is an intro; no code changes here.
 - First vid refactors the files by moving state out of child components into parents, and turns them back into statement function components.
 - Second vid refactors child components by passing callbacks upwards.
 - Third vid refactors them again by passing player index around
 - Fourth vid adds a stats component
 - Fifth vid adds an add-player form; because it's an addition, there's not as much refactoring.
 - Sixth vid adds the functionality to add players to the scoreboard
 - Seventh vid is about keeping track of state vs previous state; it reprises the sixth vid and refactors it.

 So: we need to create one new version of all the code for this.

 Designing the stopwatch
 -----------------------
 - First vid sets up the basic stopwatch
 - Second vid sets up the stopwatch state
 - Third vid makes the stopwatch track time and looks at didMount and stuff
 - Fourth vid handles the reset button
 - Fifth vid handles detaching stuff and memory leaks for uncleared setInterval()'s

 So: We don't major refactoring here and we can keep using the same code version.

 React Component Patterns
 ------------------------
  - First vid looks at wasted renders. It refactors the existing stuff into a pure component.
  - Second vid looks at destructuring props, and refactors the variable names
  - Third vid looks at refs in the DOM, and refactors the input fields
  - Fourth vid looks at prop validation with propTypes
  - Fifth vid looks at static validation - that is, using Class methods
  - Sixth vid sets up a wee challenge. This will need some refactoring too.

  So: there are extensive refactors in here, and you should use the scoreboardPatterns folder.
  Secondly, the challenge may or may not need new files - probably not, TBH.
