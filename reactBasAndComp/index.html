<!-- These lines are the CDN (content delivery network) addresses for React.
     They're a bit like the jQuery import tag you use when you're using that. The reason there's
     two separate packages is historical. react.development is for building apps in the browser,
     and react-dom.development is for customising for different machines and manipulating the
     DOM to that end. This will probably become clearer over time.
     Note also that, at the time of writing, we're on version 16. This changes frequently! -->

<!-- This is a clunky way of including babel. It's no good for a production environment, 
     as the file is too large. But it'll do for now. Babel will transpile our JSX code (fae
     app.js) into actual JavaScript that the browser can use. We also need to add the 'type'
     attribute to our app.js tag. This signals to the babel script above it that the stuff in
     app.js should be transpiled before it's executed. -->
