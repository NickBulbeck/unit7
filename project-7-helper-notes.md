Sources of help for the Unit 7 Project:

1 React basics
==============
Good place to look for setting up React classes, and how to send props
down and state wherever.

2 React components
==================
How to start off with create-react-app and, thence, split the code into
separate files. It starts where 1 React Basics left off, with create-react-app
driven file structure.

3 React Router
==============
We need React Router DOM; there are two React Routers, but the other one is for
native apps. Our app is running in the browser. So:
npm install --save react-router-dom
And mind the problem with the Treehouse course whereby the versions are incompatible.
